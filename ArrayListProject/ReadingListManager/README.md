📄 How it works

1. When the program starts, it reads saved books from `BookList.txt`.  
2. A menu is shown to the user to choose what they want to do.  
3. Any changes made during the session (like adding or removing books) will be saved to `BookList.txt` upon exiting the program.

🌟 Future Improvements

- GUI interface using JavaFX or Swing  
- Store more book details (year, genre, status: read/unread)  
- Sort and categorize books  
- Save as JSON or use a lightweight database
